# Helpful Applications for Programmers

- [7-Zip]() - Unpackage any package, period.

- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) - File syncronization across multiple computers for free.

- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) - Full featured, heavy-duty IDE.

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Version control system used by the likes of Linux and Android.

- [Google Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) - Use one as your main browser, and another as a fallback.  I pity the fool who falls back onto [IE](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie).

- [Greenshot](http://getgreenshot.org/) - Simple tools for professional looking screenshots.

- [MarkdownPad](http://markdownpad.com/) - For editing markdown documents like this slideshow and GitHub READMEs.

- [Microsoft Security Essentials](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download) or [Avast Antivirus](http://www.avast.com/index?ClickID=dozhctrtms0cr0hrrbhsb0cbssybmc2s2roy) - Antivirus software

- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Lightweight, versitile, and free text editor for programmers.  Some people use [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com/), which is slightly less feature rich, but much more beautiful.

# CMD: An Overview

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_An_Overview](./images/CMD_An_Overview.png)]]](./images/CMD_An_Overview.png)

- Problems:
  
  - Navigation  
  - Copy / Paste
  - Syntax for common tasks

- Solutions:
  
  - Workarounds (Best, see rule #1)
  - Download a CMD replacement, like [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com)
  - Install Linux

# CMD Tips: Making Your Own Commands Using .bat Files

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_Tips_3](./images/CMD_Tips_3.png)]]](./images/CMD_Tips_3.png)

**Batch Files** are text scripts that contain a series of commands to be carried out by CMD or a similar interpreters.  They can be run from CMD without their extensions.

##Steps:

1. Learn [Batch Programming](http://www.robvanderwoude.com/batchfiles.php).
2. Make a directory, call it `scripts`.  _I use `C:\Dropbox\scripts`_
3. In that directory, make `ls.bat` with containing the following two lines:
```
	@echo off
	dir %~f1
```
5. Repeat 3-4 for as many scripts as you like
6. Add the scripts folder to your `PATH` (see next slide)

name:path
# CMD Tips: Adding to Your PATH
##Through the GUI

1. Navigate to `Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System`
2. Click "Advanced system settings" on the left panel
3. Click "Environment Variables..."
4. Select the "Path" row in the "User variables for %YourName%" box.
5. Click "Edit..."
6. Change the "Variable value" to look like this:
```
"C:\OtherPaths\";"C:\MorePaths\";"C:\Full Path\To\scripts"
``` 
7. Click OK 3 times.

##Using CMD
1. To view your PATH type `echo %PATH%`
2. To set your PATH type
```
SET PATH=%PATH%;"C:\Full Path\To\scripts"
```

# Some Neat Batch Files
- **nb.bat** - Open any file in Notepad++

```

- **cr.bat** - Open a file or valid URL in Google Chrome

```
@setlocal
@echo off
set str1=%1
if exist %~f1 (
	start chrome "%~f1"
) else (
	set ok_=true
	ping -n 1 %str1%|find "Lost = 0">nul||set ok_=
	if defined ok_ (
		start chrome %1
	) else (
		echo Bad url, please check for typos.
	)
)endlocal
```

# Workflow: CMD + File Explorer

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_+_File_Explorer_1](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_1.png)]]](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_1.png)

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_+_File_Explorer_2](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_2.png)]]](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_2.png)

##Idea:

Use File Explorer most of the time, and launch CMD in current location when needed.

##Setup (Windows 8)

1. Open File Explorer (Windows Explorer)
2. Press `Alt + F` to enter the File menu, right click "Open command prompt" and click "Add to Quick Access Toolbar".
3. Press `Alt` and note the shortcut

_NB: This workflow is possible on Windows 7, but requires the use of an [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) script like [this one](http://superuser.com/questions/205359/how-to-open-command-prompt-in-current-folder-by-keyboard-shortcut)._

# Use Case: Collaboration Using Git

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_+_File_Explorer_3](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_3.png)]]](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_3.png)

[.right-side[.wrap[![CMD_+_File_Explorer_4](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_4.png)]]](./images/CMD_+_File_Explorer_4.png) 
 
##Steps

1. Press `Alt + [Number]` (Windows 8), your AutoHotKey shortcut (Windows 7/8), or hold `SHIFT`, right click, and click "Open command window here".
2. Type Git commands using CMD
3. Type `exit` to close CMD

##What is Git?
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system widely used by programmers of all kinds. It's super awesome, and you should definitely use it!  Many people use it with [Github](https://github.com/).

name:eclipse
#Workflow: Eclipse

[.right-side[.wrap[![Eclipse](./images/Eclipse.png)]]](./images/Eclipse.png)

##Principles

- IDEs mean more work upfront and less work overall

- Eclipse has an ecosystem of plugins that ensure that you can develop *virtually* any project using it.  

- Uses a series of *perspectives*, which are custimizable views designed specifically for differnet each language.

- Compatible with your current working directory: put your workspace there and import the projects.

*NB: While Eclipse does support Git in the form of EGit, Git should still be handled at the command line where it belongs.*

# Good Practices: Keeep a Working Directory

[.right-side[.wrap[![Keep_a_Working_Directory](./images/Keep_a_Working_Directory.png)]]](./images/Keep_a_Working_Directory.png)

- A directory for all of your coding projects

- Should be located at `C:\working\` for easy access
  
  *You can get there in CMD by typing* `cd/working`* from **anywhere***

- This should be your [Eclipse workspace](#eclipse), and the place where you called `git init`.
---
# Good Practices: Installing Languages

- Download an executable from the official website for the language ([python.org/download](http://python.org/download/), [ruby-lang.org/en/downlaods](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/), etc.)

- Do your very best to only only install one version of a given language at a time on your computer.  This saves a lot of heartache.

- Be consistent about where you install them.  Choose a directory close to the root and without spaces.  Choose either:
  - `C:\dev\Python27`, `C:\dev\Ruby191`, etc. OR
  - `C:\Python27`, `C:\Ruby191`, etc.

- **Run the installer yourself** (See rule #3)

- Verify installation success in CMD (be sure the executable is [in your PATH](#path)).

- Integrate with Eclipse using a plugin.
