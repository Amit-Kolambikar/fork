<h3>I'm on Flickr!</h3>

<p><em>June 29, 2013</em> </p>

<p>In a bold step towards getting into photography, I bought the Sony Alpha NEX-6, a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera with the kit 16-55mm lens.  Although I'm an absolute novice photographer, I'm trying to take myself seriously, and have committed to uploading my photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/danrschlosser">my Flickr account</a>. In an age of Dropbox and Google+ instant photo upload, I wasn't convinced that I would need a dedicated service for my photos.  My Galaxy Nexus uploads every food pic and selfie without being asked, which is great, but both Google+ and Dropbox have their disadvantages when handling pictures taken with a proper camera.  </p>

<p>Google+ is fine for smartphone photos, but any pictures larger than 2048 x 2048 start to 
<a href="https://support.google.com/plus/answer/156348?hl=en">take up valuable Google Drive storage</a>. 
For Dropbox, even my 21GB of free storage will go fast with 16.1MP (4912 x 3264) photos from my camera.  Because I'm cheep, and Flickr recently upgraded their free accounts to include a whopping 1TB of storage, I've decided to upload photos there.  </p>

<p>After having used Flickr for over a month now, I can definitely say that I'm impressed. It's great for my basic uploading and grouping needs, and the <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/danrschlosser">photostream view</a> is really nice to showcase my latest photos.  The NEX-6 is extremely portable and takes surprisingly beautiful photos, and it's nice to be able to throw my SD card into my laptop and have a batch of photos uploaded to my stream in under and hour.  </p>

<p>Flickr is far from perfect though. It lacks the ability to download photos en mass, and sharing photos to social networks is a little finicky.  It's easy to share one photo or an entire set, but there isn't an easy way to share the best three photos, for example.  The NEX-6 can beam photos to my phone over Wi-Fi Direct, which sort of solves this problem, but it would be nice to be able to post multiple photos from my computer as well.  </p>

<p>Posting to Flickr feels a little weird still, most because it's fairly disconnected from the rest of the Internet. (Who really goes and checks for updates on someone's Flickr feed?)  Unless Facebook or Google+ were able to pull in all of my Flickr photos automatically, there really isn't a great solution to these problems.  I certainly glad I moved to Flickr though, there's nothing worse than the feeling that Facebook is the only place where I store my photos online. If I want the perfect free photo-upload service, I'll have to write it myself, I guess.  Big surprise.  </p>
