<h3>A 'Hello World', of Sorts</h3>

<p><em>April 5, 2013</em></p>

<p>This is my first blog post on the new site! How exciting! This site has been in development for a while, and I certainly have some lofty goals for it in the future.  I'm considering what the best option will be for this blog, and while I may be posting intermittently, I'll do my best to keep this blog current.  This will be a place for personal blogging about technology, music, culture, or whatever else is effecting my life in the moment. I'm excited to get started!</p>
