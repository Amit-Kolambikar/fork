<h3>A "Hello World" of sorts</h3>

<p><em>April 4, 2013</em></p>

<p>How exciting, finally after over a year of rumination and weeks of development, <a href="http://danrs.ch/">danrs.ch</a> is finally live!  This site has been in the pipeline for a while, and I certainly have some lofty goals for it in the future.  On this blog page, I will share my most recent thoughts and projects. I plan to post about technology, music, culture, or whatever else is affecting my life in the moment. </p>

<p>As my website reaches launch, I want to take this opportunity to thank <a href="http://alexsander.ca">Alex Akers</a>, an iOS developer and friend who was extremely helpful in getting everything up and running.</p>

<p>If you have thoughts or comments that you would like to share, please send me an email at <a href="mailto:dan@danrs.ch">dan@danrs.ch</a>, I'd love to hear from you! Hello, World!</p>
