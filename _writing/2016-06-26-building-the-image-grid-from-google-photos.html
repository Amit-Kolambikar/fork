<p>In 2015, I decided to take a picture of everything I ate. Every sandwich, every chip, and every square of chocolate. For 365 days, if I ate it, I took a picture of it. When December rolled around, I had over 1,800 pictures with nowhere to put them. I couldn’t upload that many photos to Facebook or Instagram, and I hadn’t found a photo service that I liked enough to put my food photos on.</p>

<p>It turns out, in the course of making a website for viewing 1,800 photos I ran into a bunch of interesting technical challenges, and walked away from the whole thing with a JavaScript library called pig.js, an image grid that is <strong>faster, more responsive, and easier to use</strong> than any other solution I could find. Here’s how I built it.</p>
