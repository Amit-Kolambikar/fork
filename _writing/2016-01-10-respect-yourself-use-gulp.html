<h2>Making websites just got a lot easier.</h2>

<p>When it comes to web development, there’s a lot to learn.</p>

<p>Maybe someone has told you to use <a href="http://css-snippets.com/browser-prefix/" target="_blank">vendor prefixes</a> for <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/the-principles-of-cross-browser-css-coding/" target="_blank">cross-browser compatibility</a>, to <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/optimize-encoding-and-transfer?hl=en" target="_blank">minify your code</a> to decrease load time, or to use a linter so that your <a href="http://csslint.net/" target="_blank">CSS</a> and <a href="http://jshint.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> follows best practices. Maybe someone has ranted about how <a href="http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2014/08/5-reasons-you-should-be-using-sass-today/" target="_blank">using SCSS is better than using CSS</a>, or about why <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/templating-engines-9134396" target="_blank">templating engines are all the rage right now</a>. Or maybe this is the first you’re hearing of it, and you have no idea what setup to use.</p>

<p><strong>Trying to figure out “the right way” can be intimidating.</strong> Respect your sanity and your time: Gulp will save both.</p>
