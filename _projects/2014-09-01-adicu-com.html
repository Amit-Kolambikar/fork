<p>I built the website for <a href="https://adicu.com">ADI</a>, the Computer Science and tech club at Columbia. In the process of building this site, I also wrote <a href="/projects/eventum/">Eventum</a>, a content management system for ADI's events and blog posts. The site features the over 100 <a href="https://adicu.com/events">events</a> that ADI holds every year, as well as a detailed <a href=""></a>resources page for learning how to program.</p>
