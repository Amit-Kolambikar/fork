<p>In 2015, I was the web developer for Techinca, an all-women hackathon at University of Maryland. The Technica team was on a crazy schedule, going from idea to event in only a few months.</p>
<p>The site was one of my first to use <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> and <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>, two tools that made me extremely productive as a web developer.  The first is a collaboration tool for designers and developers.  I worked with <a href="http://jhil.co">Jeff Hilnbrand</a> on the project, and Zeplin removed all the friction between his design iterations and my implementation. Gulp is a build system that I used for the static site generation that automates all of the best practices that I employ.</p>
