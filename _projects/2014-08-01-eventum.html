<p>Eventum is an open source content management system for event-driven websites, built in Python and Flask. I wrote Eventum from scratch for <a href="https://adicu.com">ADI</a>, the tech club at Columbia, when I was redesigning their website in the summer of 2014. Building Eventum was a massive undertaking, including almost a complete rewrite a few years later.  Checkout the <a href="/writing/eventum-an-event-driven-cms/">blog post</a> I wrote motivating Eventum, or <a href="https://github.com/schlosser/eventum">contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>
