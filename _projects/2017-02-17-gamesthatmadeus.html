<p>When I moved to San Francisco from the east coast, I started up a podcast with <a href="http://nathansavoy.com">Nathan Savoy</a>, one of my oldest friends, about the video games that we played as kids. We chat and joke around about all kinds of video games (both well-known and lesser-known ones) that we played years ago and still can't stop thinking about.</p>
