    I made this website for The Next 50, an organization working to get more
    young people involved in politics. This site is pretty simple, and uses an
    animation to introduce itself. I'm really pleased with how well the design
    scaled from the home page to other pages, and how the bold footer contrasts
    with the rest of the site.

    This ultra-simple treatment of Nathan's poem calls back to an image I have
    of this poem enscribed by hand onto a wall in pencil. Back in January, I
    went to Nashville with Nathan to help our friend Conor install an exhibition
    related to this piece in a gallery at Vanderbilt.

    With this poetry collaboration, I wanted to capture the sonic elements of
    the writing. To do this, I used a series of animations to introduce each
    word. At the core of the animation is a massive list of animation variables.
    I used SCSS to transform this data into valid CSS animations. No JavaScript
    runs on this page.

    The first of three poems I recently brought to the web as a part of my
    <a href="https://poetry.nathansavoy.com/">poetry collaboration with Nathan
    Savoy</a>, this implementation pushes parallax to the max! We really liked
    the effect of the gradients mashing together. To make it work, I needed
    eight different copies of the poem in HTML, <code>overflow: hidden</code> on
    a bunch of containers, and some lightweight JavaScript to control where
    each is positioned.

    When I redesigned Isaac's personal website, we wanted to make sweeping
    changes. A modern design and color pallete, beautiful portrait photography,
    and an updated information architecture: projects, performances, and
    pedagogy. This was my first website where I feel that I was able to make
    portrait orientation images really work well with the layout, on desktop
    and mobile.

    For this redesign of Nathan's personal website, he wanted to bring a bigger
    focus to his work. After working through some options, we ended up
    featuring several pieces of his poetry, photoessays for his collaborative
    work, and some video. The striking diagonal design was super fun to play
    with for me, and brought some interesting challenges for responsive design!

    I remade Chris McCarthy's website to promote the release of his first
    album: <em>Sonder</em>. The first version of this site uses a custom-built

    Another silly one-off site for The Games that Made Us, the podcast I

    I built this portfolio site for my friend Jacob Paulson, who does fantastic
    restoration, woodworking, and other crafting.  He sent me a series of

    being a great craftsman, he's also a great photographer, which made my life

    I built the site for Interact, a community of technologists that meet

    This was my first stab at building a React app since it was first announced
    a few years back. It's a simple web UI for a Firebase backend, but it was a
    fun challenge to figure out the best practices from the React community. I
    also spent a bit of time getting it to work with my preferred Gulp build
    system, but was able to get everything working. The design, on the other
    hand, is still a work in progress.

    I made this website for my friend David Adewumi, a trumpet player who

    I made this website for Nathan Savoy, a writer, performer, and entrepreneur

    I collaborated with <a href="http://nathansavoy.com/">Nathan Savoy</a> to
    bring his poem to web. What I enjoyed most about this project was that my

    That difference in interpretation adds a lot to the page, I feel.
