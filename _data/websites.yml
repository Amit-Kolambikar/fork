    This is the website for <a href="/teams/minimill">Minimill</a>, a design
    agency that I started with <a href="http://jhil.co">Jeff Hilnbrand</a>. We
    spent a long time designing and engineering the site to be smooth, simple,
    and beautiful. I used my own
    <a href="https://github.com/minimill/pangea.js/">pangea.js</a>, alongside
    custom JavaScript to achieve this effect.

    I made this website for Nathan Savoy, a writer, performer, and entrepreneur
    living in Massachusetts. We collaborated on several other projects as well,
    which are also included on his portfolio page. I think the pure CSS
    parallax effect fits the site really well.

    I collaborated with <a href="http://nathansavoy.com/">Nathan Savoy</a> to
    bring his poem to web. What I enjoyed most about this project was that my
    reading of the poem (which drove my design) was very different than his.
    That difference in interpretation adds a lot to the page, I feel.

    This is another site I made in collaboration with
    <a href="http://nathansavoy.com/">Nathan Savoy</a>. In my interpretation
    of the poem, I worked extensively on flexing my typographic muscles.
    (They're under-used by most accounts, but it was a good learning
    experience.)

    This is the website you're using right now! My eternal pet project, and a
    guinea pig for a new version of my
    <a href="/projects/minimill-project-template/">project template</a> that
    uses Jekyll and a progressive / responsive image loader.  The build system
    performs significant image pre-processing to make the site run smoothly.

    In addition to working on their marketing site and webapp, Redspread also
    asked Minimill to develop a skin for their blog, which was self-hosted
    using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, an open-source CMS. I love
    how the header is achieved with just a subtle background-color change.

    In 2015, I took a picture of everything I ate. And I do mean everything! To
    commemerate the year, I made a website with every food picture I took that
    year, using a <a href="/projects/pig-js/">custom-built image grid inspired
    by Google Photos.</a> I also wrote

    I made this fun, interactive splash page for Professor R.A. Farrokhnia, the
    executive director of CUBE, a new graduate program being developed at
    Columbia Engineering. My favorite part of this site is the call to action,
    which is intended to be <em>hidden</em> from users!  I'm sure you'll be
    able to find it...

    website. While the design is not mine, I added
    <a href="https://github.com/minimill/pangea.js">pangea.js</a>, an animation
    framework I authored, to add animations between each pair of pages.

    Spire is a low-friction mood board I made with

    I made this website while playing around with different effects in jQuery.
    I liked the idea of having a collecion of discs that moved around in
    parallax with the content, but in a related way, and that they would stack
    in a way that felt logical.
