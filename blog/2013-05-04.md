### A "Hello World" of sorts
_April 4, 2013_

Hello, World! 

How exciting, finally after over a year of rumination and weeks of development, [danrs.ch](http://danrs.ch/) is finally live!  This site has been in in the pipeline for a while, and I certainly have some lofty goals for it in the future.  On this blog page, I will share my most recent thoughts and projects. I plan to post about technology, music, culture, or whatever else is effecting my life in the moment. 

As my website reaches launch, I want to take this opportunity to thank <a href="http://alexsander.ca">Alex Akers</a>, an iOS developer and friend who was extremely helpful in getting everything up and running.

If you have thoughts or comments that you would like to share, please send me an email at [dan@danrs.ch](mailto:dan@danrs.ch), I'd love to hear from you! Hello, World!
