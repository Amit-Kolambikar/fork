### Open Data in Schools is Possible

*March 11, 2015*

This week, the Columbia University Registrar and Columbia University Information Technology released [Vergil][vergil], a feature-packed course planner for university students. The service was met with significant student praise for being the first modern web application released by Columbia. It's more than usable, it's *useful*.  

The service, intended to improve the student experience during course selection, was developed in part due to conversations that I was a part of as a representative of the [Application Development Initiative][adi] (ADI), the tech club at Columbia.  ADI has spent years promoting open data at Columbia, and these efforts have finally seen some reward.  Vergil is proof that open data policies are possible on college campuses, even if implementing them can take a while.
