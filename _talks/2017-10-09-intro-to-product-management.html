<p>Product management can be a lot of things. Everyone has a different idea of what being a PM is like. I've had limited exposure to product management as a PM at Google, but I've learned enough to provide a basic introduction and compare product management to software engineering.</p>

<p>I gave this talk at Columbia, which covers the basics of what product management is, what the day-to-day life is like, and how it differents from engineering. I also briefly touch on interviews, and good/bad reasons to choose product management.</p>
