<p>This talk explains why web developers should be using <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>
to automates their development workflow, and how I've been using it in my development process
at <a href="https://minimill.co">Minimill</a>. While working on projects for Minimill, I developed a
<a href="https://github.com/minimill/project-template">project template</a> that has everything you
need to get started on a new web project quickly.</p><p>The talk is based on a post I wrote called
<a href="https://medium.com/@danrschlosser/respect-yourself-use-gulp-bb1d17b1640c#.kk96pxmm2">Respect Yourself!
Use Gulp</a>.  If you're interested in more details on how we use Gulp at Minimill, or
alternatives to Gulp, check out the post
