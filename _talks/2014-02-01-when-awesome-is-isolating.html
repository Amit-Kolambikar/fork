<p>Too often, hackathon organizers try to make their events &ldquo;awesome&rdquo;.</p>

<p>However, this can result in losing sight of how to attract new members, grow our communities, and focus on learning. <a href="http://devfe.st/">DevFest</a>, Columbia's week-long workshop series and hackathon, focuses on education, community, and building. In this talk I contrast DevFest with many other college hackathons, and why others should explore new models.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3L68tkWIc30">video from the first Hackcon</a> or <a href="https://static.schlosser.io/hackcon.pdf">read the slides</a>.</p>
