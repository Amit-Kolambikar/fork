<p>Do you have exposure to programming and want to build your first app? This four-part tutorial will teach you everything you need to know. If you haven't, I recommend you check out <a href="http://evan.land/jade/">From Zero to Website</a>, an awesome tutorial for first-time programmers.</p>

<p>For anyone who has written programs in at least one language, this talk walks through all of the steps to learning to build your first web application.  It covers Python, Flask, APIs, HTML, and CSS.</p>
