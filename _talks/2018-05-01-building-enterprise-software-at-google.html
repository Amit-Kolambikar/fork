<p>In my time at Google, I've built software for different audiences. For developers in my time on the Chrome and Firebase teams, and for consumers and enterprises in my time on the Drive team. Building enterprise software, I learned, requires a different set of skills. In this talk, I share how listening to customers, building a roadmap, testing and QA, and turning things off are all different for teams building enterprise software.</p>

<p>I gave this talk to a group at Pivotal Labs to share my experience of how building enterprise softare is different than building consumer or developer software. See the slides for more!</p>
