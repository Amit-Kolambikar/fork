<p>I’m not a designer. Let me start with that. I’m a developer, and I currently work in product management, so I’ve worked with a lot of great designers, but I’m not one myself. </p>
<p>For many, design can seem like magic — a dark art that only a few can master. This isn’t the case. I like to think that I bring the outsider’s view on this topic, and might be able to offer some insight into how engineers, PMs, and everyone else can pick up a bit of design.</p>

<p>I gave this talk at Columbia, which covers how first-time designers can pick up the basics: space, grids, color, type, illustration, from a propsective of understadning cognition, and human-centered design. Enjoy!</p>
