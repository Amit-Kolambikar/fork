<p>Many student-run hackathons aspire and work to grow their events, with not enough thought about how or why they should scale.</p>

<p>In this talk, I discuss <a href='https://adicu.com'>ADI's</a> <a href='http://devfe.st'>DevFest</a>
and how ADI scales DevFest in accordance with our values: education, community, and technical
excitement.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG08VXm_bFY">video from
