<p>The traditional discussion of the role of video games in our culture is misguided. Can we think about video games differently?</p>

<p>There's a reason why video games are so much fun to play. They make work fun, they have just the right level of challenge, they surprise you, and reward you for all of your hard work. Is there anything that we can take away from good video game design to improve the way we design our lives?</p>

<p>This talk, influenced by Jane McGonigal's book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reality-Broken-Games-Better-Change/dp/0143120611">Reality Is Broken</a>, offers a few suggestions for how we can use video game design to improve our lives.</p>
