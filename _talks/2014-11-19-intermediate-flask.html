<p>Made it all the way through my web development tutorial, <a href="/talks/an-accelerated-introduction-to-web-development">An Accelerated Introduction to Web Development</a>? Here's what's next.</p>

<p>Written as a natural extension of the my Accelerated Introduction to Web Development talk, this tutorial covers advanced topics in Flask, including building large Flask apps, managing dependencies, using a database, and processing form data.</p>

<p>I never presented slides with this talk, instead opting to walk through the code step by step in the README <a href="{{ page.link }}">on GitHub</a>.</p>
