## Consumption and Creation

I've been spending a lot of time recently about the things that make me happy and that I enjoy. I love spending time with friends, eating good food, and traveling. I take pride in my work, spend my free time making websites, and enjoy writing (although I rarely put my mind to doing so). I play video games, watch movies, and binge on TV.  

But I don't find satisfaction in all of these activities.  Extended satisfaction, I think, comes from creation, not consumption. As a lens to understand how I spend my time, I've found it extremely helpful.

### Food

Having just graduated and started working at Google, I haven't really been forced to learn how to cook.  The main motivation for me to cook has been for health reasons.  It's easier to watch what you eat, and to choose portion size when you cook for yourself.  As a part of my annual "let's be healthier in January" effort, I've made an effort to cook more.  A meal or two a week, nothing major. After cooking more the past few weeks, I've found that the process didn't just make me feel good for eating better food, but also left me feeling acomplished.  I live in the Mission district in San Fransisco, and so while the best burritos in the United States might be right down the street, the best I've felt after eating Mexican food was after making fajitas at home. 

### Video Games

One of my oldest hobbies is playing video games. I grew up playing games on my family's desktop PC, and then evolved to build my own rig in order to run the first Assassin's Creed game. I brought my PC to college, and, when my dorm room flooded and destroyed it, I trading in my gaming computer for a PS4.  Playing video games was part of how my friends and I would bond growing up, spending countless hours playing video games in basements, bedrooms, and in the backseat on car trips. Video games are important to me, and part of how I grew up. 

I've always struggled, however, to justify my time playing video games. I'm still not sure how I feel about them.  I love a good game from time to time, and some of the most engaging artistic experiences I've had have been with video games, but there's always a nagging feeling that I'm somehow wasting my time or at least not using it optimally.  

A few months back, I turned this hobby into something more.  I partnered up with Nathan Savoy to start a podcast where the two of us chat about games that we enjoyed playing together as kids. Nathan is one of my oldest friends, and we've played hundreds of hours of video games together. It's still a new effort, and who knows how long we'll go, but it's been really fun to shoot shit for a hour or so with Nathan talking about games.
