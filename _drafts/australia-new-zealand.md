# Australia and New Zealand

Visiting Sydney and the South Island of New Zealand.



It's rare that you get the opportunity to travel to the other side of the world.  This past April, I had the opportunity to travel for work to Sydney, Australia. To make better use of the trans-pacific flight, I decided to extend the trip by a week, and visit New Zealand.

What's better, shortly after making this plan, I found out that my childhood best friend Nathan could also join me on the trip. While I spent a week working in Sydney, he explored the city and surrounding area. In the evenings, we had dinner together and complained about jet lag. After that week concluded, we flew to New Zealand, rented a car, and spent a week exploring the south island.
