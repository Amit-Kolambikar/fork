<p>I worked with Covid Act Now as a product manager for two months during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Initially launched to encourage states to enact shelter in place orders, the website transformed as the pandemic and responses evolved. I helped to launch a redesigned homepage, county and state pages, including new metrics, email alerts, and dynamic share images per state and county that update daily.</p>
