role: Associate Product Manager Intern on Polymer

<p>For the final summer of my time at Columbia, I worked as an Associate Product Manager Intern at Google, working on the Polymer team. Polymer is a JavaScript library that allows developers to build using the future of the web platform.  Built on Web Components, Polymer is Google's vision for what the future of web development should look like.</p>

<p>On the Polymer team, I worked to help design a new <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">Polymer Project website</a>, build a Polymer samples repository, and to organize the <a href="https://www.polymer-project.org/summit/">Polymer Summit</a>, coordinating with our design team.</p>
