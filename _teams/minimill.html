<p>At the beginning of my senior year at Columbia, I founded <a href="https://minimill.co/">Minimill</a>, a design agency for branding and web with <a href="http://jhil.co">Jeff Hilnbrand</a>. We worked with Albert Wenger to publish a <a href="http://worldaftercapital.org/">website for his new book</a>, with the <a href="https://www.fin.com/">Fin</a> on their first site, with <a href="https://redspread.com/">Redspread</a> on their site, and with other companies like KPCB, Delta Airlines, and Autodesk.</p>

<p>Our philosophy at Minimill was that good web development is critical for web design. All of our web projects paried design with development, taking our client's ideas all the way to static web content. I worked on high-performance static websites, using a streamlined <a href="https://github.com/minimill/project-template">project template</a>, SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript.</p>
