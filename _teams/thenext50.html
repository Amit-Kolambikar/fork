<p>I am the technology lead for The Next 50, an organization that aims to build the most politically engaged community of young citizens in the United States. Most known for the <a href="https://thenext50.us/events/">Meet the Candidate series</a>, The Next 50 has hosted the top 2020 presidential candidates in San Francisco, New York, LA, Boston, and Chicago.</p>

<p>As the technology lead, I own the website and work with code to furthor our work on events, investing, policy, and career development. I also designed The Next 50's logo, a first for me!</p>
