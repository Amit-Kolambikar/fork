<p>ADI is the tech and Computer Science club at Columbia University. As a board member, I helped plan <a href="http://devfe.st">DevFest</a>, our week-long workshop series and hackathon, helped to found <a href="https://adicu.com/labs">ADI Labs</a>, a developer group that focuses on learning through building, and helped to organize <a href="https://adicu.com/events">Cookies and Code</a>, a welcoming space for Columbia students interested in coding, application development, tech, and/or cookies.</p>

<p>While I was a board member on ADI, I wrote <a href="/projects/eventum/">Eventum</a>, the content management system that powers their website, <a href="https://adicu.com">adicu.com</a>, which I also <a href="/projects/adi/">helped to build</a>.</p>

<p>My other focus within ADI was working on developing curriculum for our <a href="https://adicu.com/events">workshops and events</a>. I wrote <a href="/talks/an-accelerated-introduction-to-web-development/">An Accelerated Introduction to Web Development</a>, <a href="/talks/intermediate-flask">Intermediate Flask</a>, and more.</p>
