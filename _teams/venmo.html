<p>In the summer of 2014, I worked at Venmo as a Software Engineering Intern. I worked across Venmo's web stack, adding a new database model in SQL and MongoDB, building an API in Django, a separate client application in Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building out Venmo's now-closed API. I helped to build a webhook model, improve code quality and logging, test coverage, and API semantics. I also had the opportunity to work on an improved blocking feature on Venmo's iOS app.</p>
