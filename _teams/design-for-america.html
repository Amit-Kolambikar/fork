<p>Design for America is a community service organization that uses human centered design to help find sustianable solutions to problems in our local community. The Barnard-Columbia studio that I was a part of is just one of many in a <a href="http://designforamerica.com/">national network</a> of studios at college campuses.</p>

<p>I helped grow the group, mentor teams, teach design thinking skills, and form relationships with community partners in New York City. I also built the <a href="http://roadmap.bcdfa.com/">DFA Design Roadmap</a>, which is a tool for stuido members to access design resources for each stage in our design process.</p>
