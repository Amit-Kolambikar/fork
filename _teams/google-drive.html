<p>I currently work as an Associate Product Manager on the Google Drive team, in New York. I am the product owner for all native desktop clients for Drive, including Drive File Stream and Backup and Sync.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/g-suite/introducing-new-enterprise-ready-tools-google-drive/">Drive File Stream</a> is an enterprise-grade native desktop client for Windows and Mac. End users can access terrabytes of data without using hardly any hard drive space. Because Drive File Stream only syncs file and folder metadata and streams files on-demand, adminstrators can also enjoy reduced network load and fewer company files on-disk.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/introducing-backup-and-sync-google-photos-and-google-drive/">Backup and Sync</a> is an ap for Mac and PC that lets users save their pictures and files to Google Photos and Google Drive for easy access in the cloud or on any device.</p>
