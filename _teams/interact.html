<p>I'm a web developer for Interact, a community of technologists dedicated to social progress. Started in 2012 and continuing annually since then, Interact has hosted a group of fellows at an annual Fellowship Retreat.</p>

<p>As web lead, I'm responsible for the public website, as well as internal applications. In early 2019, we launched the first version of the Interact Member portal, an internal site for fellows to communicate, access shared resources, and reach out to the community.</p>
