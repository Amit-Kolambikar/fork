<p>My current gig is as an Associate Product Manager at Google, working on Firebase developer experience.  I'm working on the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>, the recently launched <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/firebase.html">Android Studio plugin</a>, and making it easier to use Firebase.</p>

<p>My work involves working with many Firebase contributing teams on cross-product features in the Firebase console, working with the Android Studio team to build the future of the Firebase Assistant, and converting feedback from Firebase developers and partners into real change.</p>
