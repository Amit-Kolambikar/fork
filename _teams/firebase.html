<p>During my first year at Google, I was an Associate Product Manager at Google, working on Firebase developer experience. I was the product owner of the the <a href="https://console.firebase.google.com/">Firebase Console</a>, the redeisgned <a href="https://firebase.google.com">website</a>, <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/">developer docs</a>, and the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/write/firebase.html">Android Studio plugin</a>.</p>

<p>My work involved working with many Firebase contributing teams on cross-product features in the Firebase console, aligned multiple stakeholders for a complete redesign of our website, as well as working with the Android Studio team to build the future of the Firebase Assistant.</p>
