<p>The summer after my freshman year, I worked at Facebook as a member of the first class of the Facebook University internship program. I spent the first three weeks learning to write Objective-C and build iOS apps, and spent the last five weeks working on the Facebook for iOS timeline team to build out new friending features in iOS 7.0. The focus of my work was on building a testing infrastructure for our feature.</p>
