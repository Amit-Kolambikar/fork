    <p>Just a few short weeks after graduating college, I set out on a two month trip to Europe.  I had the opportunity to enjoy new places, people, food, and to spend time with friends, family, and alone with myself. After spending time in Italy, Croatia, France, Spain, and the British Isles, the last stop on my trip was to Iceland, where my mom and I spent ten days driving around the Ring Road which makes a loop around the island.</p>

    <p>Our trip was not just tourism, however.  I made the trip to Iceland in order to meet several families worth of third cousins that until recently, our family had not known even existed. My great great grandfather had lived in Iceland and, when he remarried and moved to the United States with his new wife, had left his son from his first marriage in Iceland.  His son then later married and started a new branch of our family tree that didn't keep in touch with my great great grandfather or any of his decedents (including my family) until three generations later when my mom got in touch with her second cousins. After meeting them for the first time on a trip to Iceland years earlier, my mom flew with me from Scotland to Reykjavik to introduce me to my Icelandic relatives.</p>

    <h2>Reykjavik</h2>
    <h3>Meeting Long-Lost Family</h3>
    <p>When we arrived in Reykjavik, we picked up our rental car and drove to Aldis and Eystein's house. They are my mom's second cousins, older because of generational shifts, and grandparents to several young children. In the morning, they treated us to an amazing breakfast and tea, where we had the opportunity to meet many cousins of all ages.</p>

    <h2>Snæfellsnes</h2>
    <h3>The Western Peninsula</h3>
    <p>While our path around the ring road would be counterclockwise from Reykjavik (southwest Iceland), we first drove north west, to the Snæfellsnes peninsula. With the guidance of our newly met family, we got a first taste of the beautiful and unique Icelandic terrain. Our first stop was at Deildartunguhver, a vent for Iceland's plentiful hot spring water. In west Iceland, hot water is so plentiful that hot water faucets use the spring water directly, and the cold water faucets are artificially chilled!</p>

    <p>Next, we headed to Hraunfosar, the first of many waterfalls we saw on our trip. Hraunfosar is famous for the web of falls that sneak into the river from the bushes like tributaries into the main river. Just upstream a few feet is Barnafoss, a raging current with the remnants of a natural stone bridge. TODO PERSON explained that a long while back, two local children fell off the bridge while trying to cross the river. Their mother had the natural bridge demolished.  Today, a man-made bridge crosses the stream just a few feet away from where the natural bridge used to exist.</p>

    <p>The next day, we drove west, to a small coastal village called Hellnar, where we had lunch and explored a beautiful rock beach and rock formation. There's a beautiful trail from Hellnar to a the next town over that weaves between rolling rocky hills formed from lava years before.</p>
    <p>Iceland is a fairly mountainous country, with only the small flat areas by the ocean being inhabitable.  As a result, the ring road often hugs the inland mountains, creating a drastic dichotomy between the farmland and sea on one side, and a sharp rising hill or mountain on the other. Driving around Snæfellsnes was stunning, with the mountain tops disappearing into the clouds just feet away from the farmland.</p>

    <h2>The Golden Circle</h2>

    <p>After returning to Rekyjavik from Snæfellsnes, we took a loop around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle_(Iceland)">Golden Circle</a>, day-long loop inland from Reykjavik. On it, we got some great food, history, sights, and relaxation.</p>

    <p>Our last stop, where the were unfortunately no photos, was at the Secret Lagoon, a natural, open-air hot spring where we got to float and relax around in the pool for an hour or so to end our long day. It wasn't our first time in a hot spring (nor our last), but it definitely took the cake for best atmosphere. The pool ran right up to a rocky vent, that was too hot to even approach!</p>

    <h2>Þórsmörk</h2>
    <h3>"Thor's Mork"</h3>
    <p>Probably the most magnificent part of our trip around Iceland was the day we spent in Þórsmörk, a national park surrounding a massive riverbed. Together with my third cousin Elsa, her daughter TODO NAME, and one of her friends from school, my mom and I drove inland from the ring road into the park.</p>

    <p>The only way to get into Þórsmörk is to drive along the riverbed, parallel with the river, which can shift dramatically from season to season.  in places, the river bed can be almost a mile wide, but when we went in the summer, the river itself only took up a small fraction of that (maybe 100-200ft wide or so). The tricky thing is that there are many small waterfalls and tributaries that lead into the main river, and the makeshift road that runs along the river crosses through them.  This meant that only large tour buses with massive wheels or a enterprising group of people in a 4x4 can make it past.  We were in the later camp.</p>

    <p>Sitting shotgun in Elsa's SUV, I watched as she bravely switched on all wheel drive, and expertly analyzed each river crossing, attempting to find the shallowest part of the stream to drive through.  Then, we'd hold on tight and forge our way across the tributaries (some of which were up to 50ft wide).  Even on her SUV, the water rose up to almost cover our wheels at points.  Pretty thrilling!</p>

    <p>From the base camp, we left for a hike up a nearby mountain.  To get there, we had to cross the riverbed on foot, and then hike up the mountain. It didn't take long (only a few hours) to do the whole hike, but the view of the riverbed and glacier was amazing.</p>
