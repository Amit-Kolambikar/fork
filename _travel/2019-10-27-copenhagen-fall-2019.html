<section class="text">
    <p>In October, I left my job at <a href="/teams/google-drive">Google</a> to start a new role at <a href="/teams/new-york-times/">The New York Times</a>. I only had a week off in between jobs, but I wanted to make good use of it. Thus far, 2019 had taken me to <a href="/travel/australia-winter-2019/">Australia</a>, <a href="/travel/israel-jerusalem-summer-2019/">Israel and Jerusalem</a>, <a href="/travel/japan-summer-2019/">Japan</a>, and <a href="/travel/chile-summer-2019/">Chile</a>. By all accounts, I was sick of international travel, if such a thing is possible. I was grateful for the privilege to be able to travel to these amazing countries, and glad to have the time off, but part of me just wanted to stay home.</p>
    <p>And then, my better instincts kicked in. Instead of spending a week backpacking around a dozen cities in Asia or trekking through the wilderness in Central America, I decided to spend my entire week in Copenhagen. The goal was not to see everything, or maximize my time in northern Europe. (Many friends suggested visiting Denmark, Sweden, and Norway in one go.) Instead, my focus was on enjoyment, a relaxed pace, and recuperation that would clear the slate for my new job.</p>
    <p>Copenhagen had a lot to offer that I was excited about. From architecture and design to history and art, the museums and cultural centers in Copenhagen were what drew me in most directly. I was also interested to experience firsthand the progressive civic design of the city; Copenhagen is famous for its bike lanes and walkability. So, after wrapping up things at Google and a day trip to Maryland for my cousin's wedding, I hopped on the train to JFK.</p>

    <h2>Copenhagen</h2>
    <p>My trip started with a flight through Amsterdam into Copenhagen. Getting into the city from the airport was a breeze, with a swipe of the Copenhagen Card I purchased online following recommendations from friends. The <a href="https://copenhagencard.com/">Copenhagen Card</a>, grants tourists unlimited use of the public transportation and free passes to almost all museums and tourist destinations. It was more than worth the price for my six-day stay. Every single museum I visited was covered for free, as were other attractions like Tivoli Gardens, Copenhagen's famous amusement park.</p>
    <p>After dropping off my bags, I wandered off into the city to explore.</p>

    <p>I spent much of the next few days visiting museums in Copenhagen. Across several visits, it was my first impression really stuck with me: density! From history to art and design, I found that many museums in Copenhagen offered an overwhelming number of pieces in a small space. While perhaps detracting from the interest or impact of any individual piece, the density of these collections led me to slow the pace at which I moved through the museum.</p>

    <p>After several days in Copenhagen, I decided to take a short trip west to Ishøj, a coastal town home to the ARKEN Museum for Moderne Kunst.

    <h2>Returning to Copenhagen</h2>
    <p>After a fulfilling week and a full day in Humlebaek at the Louisiana Museum, I returned to Copenhagen for my last full day. Remaining on my list were the stragglers: visits I hadn't gotten around to during the week but had as backup options. Little did I know, my last day would be one of my favorites in Copenhagen.</p>
    <p>My first stop was the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, an art museum in central Copenhagen. I arrived right before the museum opened, and without any bags to check, I was one of the first people into the building. My reward was some fantastic pictures of the exhibitions and atrium before they flooded with visitors.</p>

    <p>My next stop was at the Thorvaldsens Museum. If I had even remotely done my homework, I would have known that Bertel Thorvaldsen, a Danish sculptor was one of the best working in Rome at the turn of the 19th century. I was about to see more amazing sculpture!</p>

    <h5>Unlike many other museums in Copenhagen, which used a myriad of pieces to create a dense collage of artwork, the Thorvaldsens Museum has a series of small rooms that focus on a single large piece. Some smaller supporting pieces line the side walls.</h5>
